## Course Description

::: justify-text
This course aims to provide an overview of statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of longitudinal data, or data collected on multiple units (individuals, states, dyads, countries) at more than one point in time. The course will focus on models for the analysis of "panel data," which by convention is used to describe data with a relatively large number of units and relatively few time points. The emphasis throughout will be on taking advantage of the benefits that panel data provide the researcher in making inferences about causal dynamics, while at the same time being sensitive to the specific problems and complexities that emerge when conducting panel analyses. On the benefits side, panel data provides the researcher with increased ability to:

1.  model directly individual-level change and growth in dependent variables
2.  estimate models that control for unmeasured unit-specific effects or 'unobserved heterogeneity'
3.  test alternative lag structures and models of reciprocal causality between variables
4.  estimate models that specify and account for variation in individual-level intercepts, slopes and/or rates of change over time
5.  estimate causal effects after controlling for the confounding effects of measurement error

We'll begin by situating panel analysis within a general framework for causal inference. We'll then provide an overview of panel models from each of the three traditional approaches that dominate the field: the "econometric" tradition emphasizing unobserved heterogeneity; the "structural equation" tradition emphasizing models with reciprocal causality and measurement error; and the "multilevel modeling" tradition emphasizing models with longitudinal growth and random coefficients. As will become clear, these traditions are increasingly converging, and it is more and more common now in the panel literature to see models that incorporate features of each. It is also the case that nearly all panel models from each tradition can now be estimated in Stata 15 (which we will use in the course) and a wide range of other statistical software packages.

A note on the mathematical/statistical difficulty in the course. There will not be an emphasis on derivations of appropriate statistical estimators and so forth; rather, the emphasis will be on grasping the underlying logic of the various models, understanding how, when, and why to use them to achieve the goals specified above in your own research, and learning how to profit from, and to critique, published works in the discipline that make use of these techniques. There will be a reasonable amount of mathematics, formulas, etc., that will be needed to understand the various models and methods, but all of it will be presented in ways that, ideally, will help guide your own research endeavors. I am assuming only that you have had basic courses in regression and the linear model (i.e., the equivalent of PS2030).

## Course Requirements

::: justify-text
Grades will be based on a 20--25 page research paper (40%), two homework exercises which relate to specific statistical methods and problems we will discuss (25% each), and an oral presentation (with PowerPoint and/or related materials) of your research paper (10%). The paper will be a quantitative analysis, using methods from this course, of longitudinal panel data that you will collect or access from social science archives or other sources. The paper should have some substantive interest to you or be relevant to your studies in the graduate program; ideally, you can think of it as the first draft of a master's thesis, convention paper, or possible journal publication. The paper will discuss your basic theoretical framework, your hypotheses, statistical models, results, possible problems with the analysis and what you may have done to correct or account for these problems. It will conclude with a discussion of the relevance of your findings for the general topic and for future research.

The homework exercises will be periodic problems or data to analyze and will illustrate aspects of the statistical techniques being covered in class.

## Course Outline

The course is organized by units and then topics within units. We will maintain a certain amount of flexibility with the schedule, so that we can spend more time on some topics/units and scale back on others as circumstances warrant.
